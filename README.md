- 👋 Hi, I’m Sergio Venturini. I'm a video editor interested in programming, totally amateur.
- 👀 I’m interested in finding solutions for video-editing problems. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, by myself
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on my project, that is sort of a Premiere Compatibility API to other Open Source Video Editors, and some kind of software that enables full premiere project file manipulation.

📫 How to reach me: sergioaventurini@gmail.com
